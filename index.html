              From early 2000 through the end of the decade (into early 2011), I made electronic music.  Generally, the the type/ "vibe" varied:  electronica/ experimental/ house/ techno/ etc.<br>
              I've made much of my work available on <a href="https://www.4shared.com/u/TdRl2ThD/Omar_Cabaleiro.html" target="_blank">4shared</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKoYTByij9ee4s3Kv52UtCwQi-M4Yvqzq" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              My only official release was of the techno track, "Delta."  <a href="https://doboxrecordings.com/releases/dbdf033" target="_blank">DoBox Recordings</a> included it on its compilation album, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/1174987-Various-Resurgence" target="_blank">Resurgence</a>, which was released on December 4, 2007 (the day before my 31st birthday).

              From October 2000 through the end of the decade (into early 2011) I worked as a Personal Fitness Trainer, on-and-off.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent the first half of that working within the big box gym model.  Though aware of the dynamic, at the time I was never able to successfully adapt to the fact that these were actually sales jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the second half of my time as a trainer I worked via in-home training services.  Being able to focus on training people, and not having to do any selling, was a massively welcome change for me.

        <h3>1990s</h3>
        <ul>

            <p>
              Toward the end of 1990, early in my freshman year of high school, an old friend and classmate with whom I'd been reuinited introduced me to underground house and techno.  This was via mixtapes which he let me borrow, and I was instantly hooked.<br>
              Beginning in either late 1990, or early 1991, I started to (more or less compulsively) buy house and techno records.  This continued all the way through the entire rest of the '90s.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summer of 1993, prior to my senior year of high school, I got my first ever DJ set up, and I kept up with that pursuit through the end of the decade (into at least 2000.  I believe my last gig may have been in 2002, or later, just accepting a friend's invitation to do so.)<br>
              I mostly focused on making mixtapes, especially in the beginning.  Eventually I started doing a few mobile gigs with friends here and there.<br>
              Eventually I got more involved in doing bar/ club/ "rave"/ etc gigs.  This was mostly throughout (mainly northeastern) NJ, but also a bit in PA, and NYC (the southern half of Manhattan).<br>
              DJ Furious was my stage name, for the most part.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summer of 1996, with a few friends, I started to venture into nightlife promotion.  It was at that time that I had my first ever nightclub gig (I booked myself).<br>
              I contiued on through the end of the decade (into 2000), on my own more and more.  At first this was all in northeastern NJ, but I eventually tried doing a couple of weeklies in NYC (Union Square and Chelsea areas, both during the first half of 2000), without much success, but I (more or less) enjoyed the experience of it all.

              During my time DJing I also got into graphic design, mostly to make covers for my mixtapes.<br>
              This was a fortunate shift in my visual arts activity, away from graffiti, a habit which I'd picked up in 1991, while attending summer school.<br>
              (I can remember being into drawing in the '80s; comic book-style characters, though I wasn't nearly that good.)

              The late '90s, about a year or so out of high school, was when I basically "joined the workforce."
