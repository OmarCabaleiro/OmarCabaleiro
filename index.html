              From November 2012 to mid-2019 I worked in Nightlife Security, almost exclusively.  Until I got into this line of work (approaching my 36th birthday), I generally could not hold down a job to save my life.  This was the first time I ever really felt (primally) useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are the cities I worked at, in descending order of time I spent working there (as well as I can remember), along with the specific venues:<br>
              Passaic, NJ:  Fuego Fuego the VIP Lounge, Fiesta Night Club, El Tropical Niteclub<br>
              Paterson, NJ:  Mamajuana Cafe<br>
              Newark, NJ:  El Merengue Restaurant & Lounge, Robert Treat Hotel<br>
              Hoboken, NJ:  McSwiggans Pub, Maxwell's<br>
              New York, NY:  Jimmy's 38 NYC<br>
              Jersey City, NJ:  Surf City<br>
              West New York, NJ:  Son Cubano<br>
              There are more than a half dozen other places where I worked, including another NYC venue and a couple of go-go bars, but I didn't really spend enough time at them to "give myself credit" for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first night on the job was at an Antony Santos concert at the Robert Treat Hotel in Newark, NJ.  Incidentally, most of my time in this field was at Dominican venues.  At Fuego Fuego in particular, I saw many live acts.  Especially during its first year, week after week, they were bringing in the most popular artists in the genres of bachata, merengue tipico, and dembow.  The place would be jam-packed.
            </p>

              I worked almost exclusively via security companies, but I was a direct hire at Maxwell's. I worked there a for a few weeks around early spring of 2013.  As doorman, I was basically always posted right outside the entrance.<br>
              One day though, I was working inside, in the main area just inside the hallway leading to the concert room in the back (I was across from the jukebox).  Todd, the guy who hired me, happened to be standing next to the jukebox at that moment (on the bar side), when a guy who'd caught my eye earlier walked by into the main bar area.  I went up to Todd and said, "That tall dude reminds me of the guy from Sonic Youth."  He kind of chuckled to himself and said, "That's because it is the guy from Sonic Youth."  I then told him that my 2 favorite rock bands were Alice in Chains and Sonic Youth.  He seemed (pleasantly) surprised to hear that.<br>
              I bought the CDs and listened to the music, but didn't really keep up with band news, and I was never really a concertgoer, so I had no idea that Chelsea Light Moving, which was playing there that night, was Thurston Moore's new band.<br>
              Later in the evening, when I was back outside, a fellow employee came out and told me Todd said I could go inside to watch the band perform, so I did.  That was pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p>
              A musician named Fred worked at Maxwell's.  He'd come outside every now and then to smoke a cigarette (if I remember correctly), and we'd talk about this and that, but mostly Naruto:  Shippuden, etc.  On one occasion, the subject of The Venture Bros. came up, and I mentioned how it was my all-time favorite show (animated or live action).  That was when he told me that he was actually the bassist for Doc Hammer's band, Weep.

              There were at least 2 or 3 outdoor Mexican festivals/ rodeos in Passaic, NJ which I worked security at.  Seeing the bulls up close while they were penned up, it was impressive how jacked AF they were.<br>
              Also, watching the performances in person was wild.  The riders looked like rag dolls while on the bucking bulls, literally.  It was uncanny how much it didn't seem like it was an actual person on there during those moments.<br>
              This was my first time ever trying actual Mexican(-style) tacos; nice.
            </p>
            <p>
              It wasn't until after I left this line of work, at ~42.5 years of age, that I could fully appreciate the extent to which it served me as a much needed, intensive remediation of my social skills; a recluse, with some pretty hardcore social anxiety, serving in a conflict resolution capacity within, as far as I'm aware, the most intensively social type of environment that exists.

            <p>
              From early 2000 through the end of the decade (into early 2011), I made electronic music.  Generally, the type/ "vibe" varied:  electronica/ experimental/ house/ techno/ etc.<br>
              I've made much of my work available on <a href="https://www.4shared.com/u/TdRl2ThD/Omar_Cabaleiro.html" target="_blank">4shared</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKoYTByij9ee4s3Kv52UtCwQi-M4Yvqzq" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

            <p>
              My only official release was of the techno track, "Delta."  <a href="https://doboxrecordings.com/releases/dbdf033" target="_blank">DoBox Recordings</a> included it on its compilation album, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/1174987-Various-Resurgence" target="_blank">Resurgence</a>, which was released on December 4, 2007 (the day before my 31st birthday).

              From October 2000 through the end of the decade (into early 2011) I worked as a Personal Fitness Trainer, on-and-off.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent the first half of that working within the big box gym model.  Though aware of the dynamic, at the time I was never able to successfully adapt to the fact that these were actually sales jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the second half of my time as a trainer I worked via in-home training services.  Being able to focus on training people, and not having to do any selling, was a massively welcome change for me.

        <h3>1990s</h3>

            <p>
              Toward the end of 1990, early in my freshman year of high school, an old friend and classmate with whom I'd been reuinited introduced me to underground house and techno.  This was via mixtapes which he let me borrow, and I was instantly hooked.<br>
              Beginning in either late 1990, or early 1991, I started to (more or less compulsively) buy house and techno records.  This continued all the way through the entire rest of the '90s.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summer of 1993, prior to my senior year of high school, I got my first ever DJ set up, and I kept up with that pursuit through the end of the decade (into at least 2000.  I believe my last gig may have been in 2002, or later, just accepting a friend's invitation to do so.)<br>
              I mostly focused on making mixtapes, especially in the beginning.  Eventually I started doing a few mobile gigs with friends here and there.<br>
              Eventually I got more involved in doing bar/ club/ "rave"/ etc gigs.  This was mostly throughout (mainly northeastern) NJ, but also a bit in PA, and NYC (the southern half of Manhattan).<br>
              DJ Furious was my stage name, for the most part.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summer of 1996, with a few friends, I started to venture into nightlife promotion.  It was at that time that I had my first ever nightclub gig (I booked myself).<br>
              I contiued on through the end of the decade (into 2000), on my own more and more.  At first this was all in northeastern NJ, but I eventually tried doing a couple of weeklies in NYC (Union Square and Chelsea areas, both during the first half of 2000), without much success, but I (more or less) enjoyed the experience of it all.

              During my time DJing I also got into graphic design, mostly to make covers for my mixtapes.<br>
              This was a fortunate shift in my visual arts activity, away from graffiti, a habit which I'd picked up in 1991, while attending summer school.<br>
              (I can remember being into drawing in the '80s; comic book-style characters, though I wasn't nearly that good.)

              The late '90s, about a year or so out of high school, was when I basically "joined the workforce."
