    <h2>Fitness Blog</h2>
    <p>
      Basically, I started this blog as a place where I can have an occasional brain dump of my training ideas.<br>
      It has occurred to me many times throughout the years to simply do this in my training notebook(s).<br>  Apparently, potentially having an audience was the final piece of motivation I needed in order to follow through.

      My posts generally have to do with what I'm most interested in as far as my own training goes:<br>
      a minimalist approach to building athletically functional strength and muscle mass.<br>
      Also, the programming reflects my own biases/ preferences for managing different training variables:<br>
       -high frequency<br>
       -(very) low volume and, particularly, duration<br>
       -variable (absolute/ relative) intensity

      <h3>Some Relevant Background Info*</h3>

        (*where I'm coming from with my ideas on, and approach to, physical training)

            I played varsity (the only team my school had) and intramural soccer in high school from 1990-94.<br>
            In ‘98 and ‘99 I played 2 seasons, on 2 different teams, in my hometown’s men’s recreational soccer league. 
          </p>

            3 months of taekwondo was the first martial arts training I ever received.  I started in summer, continuing into the early part of my sophomore year of high school.  That was the only season that I didn’t play on the soccer team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having enlisted with the U.S. Marine Corps, I shipped off to bootcamp in November 1997, but flunked out pretty quickly.  At the time, the USMC was still teaching the LINE combat system.  Those few training sessions were my first ever direct exposure to military combatives, and to the concept of explicitly no-quarter hand-to-hand combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            In mid-2008 I returned to training in the martial arts, via Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  I trained a lot throughout the late 2000’s, continuing sporadically into the early 2010s.  I trained almost exclusively in combat sports, but also tried out a couple of traditional Japanese martial arts.  As far as my combat sports training, the vast majority of it was in (gi and no-gi) grappling.

            Midway through my senior year of high school, just after having received a gym membership as a Christmas gift from my parents, was when I first started “going to the gym.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t until roughly 2.5 years later though, approaching mid-1996 that, with a couple of friends, I started getting into intense resistance training.  We were definitely “skipping leg day,” and yes, maxing out on the bench press was the weekly “main event” of our regimen.
          </p>
          <p>
            About a couple of years in I started training on my own more and more.  This was when I got into the habit of keeping a training journal.<br>
            Somewhat ironically, it wasn’t until around the time when I decided I was no longer gonna play soccer that I started resistance training my lower body increasingly intensively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Very early in the 2010s I made the transition from training at commercial gyms to training at home with my own equipment.  This period was when I first got into sandbag training.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Holy shit, yoga is hard AF"  was what came to mind in October of 2020, when I began seriously exploring yoga and trying to build a daily practice for the first time in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I finally made kettlebells a part of my training in mid-2021; clubbells in early 2022.

            During the late ‘90s I attended college on-and-off, switching majors multiple times.  Physical Education was 1 of the 2 majors which I remember spending the most time in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either in late 2000 or early 2001, while at my first Personal Trainer job (Bally Total Fitness in Livingston, NJ), I attained the AAAI/ ISMA Personal Fitness Trainer certification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the second half of 2007 I attended a 720-hour Massage Therapy course, graduating that following January.
          </p>
          <p>
            In October 2013, I attained the Underground Strength Coach Level 1 certification. taught by the system's founder, Zach Even-Esh (whose work I'd been a fan of since roughly the mid-2000s).  That was my first time ever even touching kettlebells, or a trap bar, or flipping a tractor tire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout 2018, with the objective of returning to working in fitness, I attained several more certifications; in chronological order:  Poliquin Personal Trainer Level 1, USA Gymnastics University: Instructor, CrossFit Level 1 Trainer, USA Weightlifting Level 1 Coach, ACE Personal Trainer.<br>
            Also, in 2020, I attained the USA Powerlifting Club Coach cert.<br>
            During that same period of ~3 years there were also some other programs which I started but did not finish.  Since I never actually attained those certs, I won’t specifically name them here.<br>
            I will say though, that 2 of them were nutrition-related, 1 was powerlifting-related, 1 was for soccer coaching, and another was for teaching yoga.

            From October 2000 into early 2011 I worked as a Personal Trainer, on-and-off.  I spent the first half of that in big box gyms, or at least that business model.  Throughout the second half, I worked via in-home training services.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early 2008 (around Q2, if I remember correctly), I briefly worked as a Massage Therapist.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late 2013 I volunteered as “Conditioning Coach” with a local (Newark) men’s amateur soccer team, competing in the Premier division of North Jersey Soccer League.  I worked 1-on-1 with a couple of the players, but beyond that, I basically just led the team warm-ups.

            From November 2012 into mid-2019 I worked in Nightlife Security, largely exclusively.  This was mainly throughout northeastern NJ; the cities I worked in most being Newark, Paterson, Passaic, and Hoboken.  In the end I was working in midtown NYC.  My most notable gig in this line of work was likely a brief stint as doorman at the iconic Maxwell’s, in Hoboken, NJ (early 2013).
