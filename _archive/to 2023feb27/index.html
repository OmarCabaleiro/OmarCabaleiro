				<h3><u>2020s</u></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Becoming a self-taught Programmer is currently my (more or less) top priority.  After several false starts, the earliest of which dates back to around 2019, I finally committed to the process in late summer of 2022.  I'm presently working on building my <a href="https://github.com/OmarCabaleiro" target="_blank">portfolio</a>, focusing mainly on (Front End) Web Development.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>A return to Personal Training is also definitely in the cards.  It's the only area in which I'm functionally an expert and, accordingly, the area which would provide me the most favorable "income-to-hassle ratio," due to how well it matches with my own skills and interests.</p>
						<p>In this realm, for the most part, I'm really only interested in working with high-profile individuals whose livelihoods depend on their physical performance and/ or appearance; even more specifically, combat athletes and adult entertainers.</p>

						<p>Nightlife Security was my primary line of work, almost exclusively so, from November 2012 through the end of the decade (into early 2021).  My first gig was an Antony Santos concert in Newark, NJ.  I worked mostly throughout northeastern New Jersey (Newark, Paterson, Hoboken, Jersey City, etc), but also a bit in NYC (Mid-to-Lower Manhattan), particularly in 2019.</p>
						<p>Maxwell's in Hoboken, NJ is the most renowned venue at which I worked.  Some others would include Mamajuana Cafe Paterson (also in NJ) and Jimmy's 38 NYC, in Manhattan's Garment District.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>In 2013 I returned to pursuing Personal Trainer-related certifications, with Underground Strength Coach Level 1, while I was volunteering as Conditioning Coach for a local men's amateur soccer team, Garden State Croatia F.C.  I stopped until 2018, when I attained, in chronological order: Poliquin Personal Trainer Level 1, USA Gymnastics University: Instructor, CrossFit Level 1 Trainer, USA Weightlifting Level 1 Coach, and ACE Personal Trainer (also, in 2020, USA Powerlifting Club Coach).</p>

				<h3><u>2000s</u></h3>

					<li>
						<p>From October 2000 through the end of the decade (into 2011), my primary line of work was Personal Training, on-and-off.</p>
						<p>I began at a big box gym and, throughout the early 2000s, it was within that same business model that I continued to do my work in this field.  From 2005 on (into 2011), my experience as a trainer was pretty much all as an employee of In-Home Personal Training services.  It wasn't until 2010 that I finally tried freelancing for the first time.</p>

						<p><a href="https://www.4shared.com/u/TdRl2ThD/Omar_Cabaleiro.html" target="_blank">Electronic Music Production</a> was my primary pursuit in life, for the most part, from the beginning of 2000 through the end of the decade (into early 2011).  I stopped collecting records, along with my Nightlife Promotion efforts, some time in 2000.  My last DJ gig was in 2002, if I remember correctly.</p>
						<p>The techno track <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/1174987-Various-Resurgence" target="_blank">"Delta"</a> was my only official music release.  It was on net label DoBox Recordings' compilation album Resurgence, which came out toward the end of 2007.  I had been introduced to MySpace by a classmate early in 2006, which is where I connected with the label founder, as well as some other musicians who were on the album (and many other musicians whose music I'd been a fan of throughout the '90s during my DJ-ing days).</p>

				<h3><u>1990s</u></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>I was introduced to Underground House and Techno music genres in late 1990, during my freshman year of high school, and started collecting records shortly thereafter.</p>
						<p>From late 1990/ early 1991 (into 2000) I collected Electronic Music vinyl records fairly obsessively.</p>
						<p>From 1993 through the end of the decade DJ-ing was my primary pursuit in life.  I mostly played gigs throughout (northeastern) New Jersey, but also some in NYC (throughout the southern half of Manhattan), and eastern Pennsylvania.  Until the year 2000 or so, when I started going by my real name, I performed under the stage name "DJ Furious" (at gigs and on mixtapes).</p>
						<p>In summer of '96 I got into Nightlife Promotion with some friends, in New Jersey.  Eventually (2000), I went solo with it and started focusing on NYC (Manhattan- a bit in Union Square area, but mainly in Chelsea).</p>
